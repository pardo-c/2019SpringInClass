Reminder: relational databases are very structure/rigid. Need to set them up in advance. Only can use the structure you set up.
We will use raw MySQL and Node--different from the youtube tutorial.

When it comes to MySQL and running it on wyverna and connecting it to our Node and having our middleware/application server
Javascript running in your browser can never access/ make direct connection to databases

JS sends http messages to Node and receives http messages back. 

Three teir: whats running in browser, application server, database server. 

The node server connecting to MySQL has one more thing. Right now we are inside the SUNY NP firewall,
or if you are working from Node. You will have to have a way to end MySQL messages back and forth
between database and Node. So you will need to bypass firewall. One way: SSH (bitvise) it is a Windows app. What about Linux/Ubuntu?

bitvise does "tunneling" for you. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding
"Port forwarding via SSH (SSH tunneling) creates a secure connection between a local computer and 
a remote machine through which services can be relayed. 
Because the connection is encrypted, SSH tunneling is useful for 
transmitting information that uses an unencrypted protocol, such as IMAP, VNC, or IRC. "
